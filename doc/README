/usr/opt/wrdapp/modflow/doc/README:


This README file lists the minor differences between the modflow
distribution furnished by Arlen Harbaugh and this distribution:

1.  This README file is added.

2.  A Unix "man" page is added.

3.  An expanded Makefile is added to automate installation and clean-up

4.  Test scripts are provided with standard data sets to allow verification
    that modflow is installed and functioning correctly.

5.  The following directory structure has been created 
    (shown at right are the contents of each directory):

   modflow
     `-----bin             : modflow Data General AViiON executable
     `-----doc             : text version of man page
     `-----src             : modflow source code and Makefile
     `-----test            : scripts to run verification tests
     `-----data            : standard datasets used in verification tests



Users should now read the file readme located in the modflow directory for a
description of the modflow distribution, how to install modflow, how to execute 
modflow, and how to test the installation.  Refer to the Unix man page (text
version included in this directory) for additional a brief description of MODFLOW,
version history, references, and contacts.
